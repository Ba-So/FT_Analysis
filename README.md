# FT_Analysis
Python: Program to create probability distributions and fluctuation analysis of raw data.

The Fluctuatuion Theorem links the propabilities of two processes ln(p(<x(0) & x'(t)>) / p(<x'(0) & x(t)>)) = 1.
This bunch of code lines is supposed to read, analyse and print the resuling plots from some inital data set. 

Currently it's a petty mess due to a lack of version control and my inexpirence in coding.
